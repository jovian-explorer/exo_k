About `Exo_k`
=============

`Exo_k` is a Python 3 based library to handle radiative opacities from various sources for atmospheric applications.
It enables you to:

* Interpolate efficiently and easily in correlated-k and cross section tables.
* Convert easily correlated-k and cross section tables from one format to another (pickle, hdf5, LMDZ GCM format).
* Adapt precomputed correlated-k tables to your needs by changing:

  * the resolution and quadrature (g) grid,
  * the pressure/temperature grid.
* Create tables for a mix of gases using tables for individual gases.
* Create your own tables from high-resolution spectra.
* Use your data in an integrated radiative transfer framework to simulate planetary atmospheres.
  
On this website, you'll find a 'Getting Started' section that will show you how to do all that.
You'll also find all the references to the various classes and methods. This documentation is
searchable with the search bar in the top left corner. 

Enjoy!
